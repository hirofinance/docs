# About

Velodrome Finance, at its core, is a solution for protocols on [arbitrum](https://www.arbirtrum.io/) to properly incentivize liquidity for their own use cases.
Building on top of the groundwork laid out by Solidly, our team has addressed that first iteration's core issues to realize its full potential.

## Who is behind this project?

The team behind Velodrome Finance previously launched
[veDAO](https://twitter.com/_vedao_), an initiative incubated by [Information Token](https://informationtoken.io). veDAO's founding mandate was to engage with
the Solidly ecosystem, a protocol launched on the Fantom network by Andre
Cronje, while driving long-term value to the veDAO community.

The veDAO team has since developed deep subject matter expertise on both
Solidly, the veNFT primitive, and the ve(3,3) mechanism, becoming the go-to resource for protocols and
chains seeking support around these topics.

By the numbers, veDAO, managed to attract $2.6B in TVL (total value locked) in the early days,
securing ~10% of Solidly voting power and ~$1.1M USDC in treasury assets.
