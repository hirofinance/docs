# Expand Exchange

# About

Expand Exchange, at its core, is a solution for protocols on [arbitrum](https://www.arbirtrum.io/) to properly incentivize liquidity for their own use cases.
Building on top of the groundwork laid out by Solidly, our team has addressed that first iteration's core issues to realize its full potential.

## Who is behind this project?

Expand Exchane is a project built based on the original designs of Andre Cronje's Solidly which was later revised and made wildly successful by Velodrome Finance.
